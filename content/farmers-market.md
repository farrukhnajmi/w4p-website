Volunteers from Wellfleet for Palestine staff a nonprofit table near the 
entrance of Wellfleet Farmers Market every Wednesday between May 21, 2025, 
and October 15, 2025. 

We sell Palestinian products supporting humanitarian aid and education in 
Palestine through the following non-profits:

* Tree Of Life Educational Fund (TOLEF) https://tolef.org/

* Middle East Children’s Alliance (MECA) https://www.mecaforpeace.org/

All profits from the sales are donated back to above organizations to support humanitarian aid and education
in Palestine.

We currently sell the following products from Palestine:

* Organic Olive Oil $25
* Za’atar $12
* Olive Oil Soap $8

We also provide free tasting of our Olive Oil and Za'atar and offer free solidarity buttons.

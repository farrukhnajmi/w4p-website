It has been published since 1919 and is sometimes referred to as the country's "newspaper of record". Haaretz's editorial line opposes Israeli control of Palestinian territories, supports peace initiatives, and advocates for weaker segments of Israeli society. The newspaper has been a target of right-wing administrations in the past. |

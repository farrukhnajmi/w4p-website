# Who We Are
Wellfleet for Palestine 🇵🇸 (W4P) is a group of Wellfleet residents who are committed to
freedom, equality and justice for Palestinians.

# Why We Exist as a Group
* We have seen a livestreamed Israeli genocide every day since October 2023.
  * Tens of thousands of children have been murdered. [Many of them have been target-killed by Israeli snipers with perfect dead-center shots to their head and heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36b6TjdLxSg). 
  * Hospitals, schools, churches, mosques have been bombed by Israel.
  * [192 journalists](https://cpj.org/2025/08/israel-kills-al-jazeera-journalists-in-targeted-gaza-city-airstrike/), [over a thousand healthcare professionals](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/remembering-our-colleagues-killed-gaza), and first responders have been target-killed by Israel.
  * [2 million people are being force-starved to death](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/07/gaza-evidence-points-to-israels-continued-use-of-starvation-to-inflict-genocide-against-palestinians/) by Israel, 1.1 million of them are children.
  * [Murder and ethnic cleansing by Israeli settlers and army in the West Bank are being done openly and with complete impunity](https://zeteo.com/p/settler-walks-free-as-israel-holds?utm_source=publication-search).
* We have seen billion of dollars of US tax payer funds be used to repeatedly arm Israel to facilitate its genocide in Gaza and its bombing of Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iran.
* We have seen the US government bomb Iran under false pretenses on Israel's behalf
* We have seen bipartisan support for Israel's genocide in Congress including the [sanction of ICC and disregard for its ruling](https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/07/11/strong-push-back-against-us-sanctions-on-the-international-criminal-court-at-un) aimed at stopping Israel's genocide.
* We have seen the governments of the great powers of the world and the power brokers within every aspect of their civil societies, including the media, the large corporations, the many boards of institutions such as [universities](https://www.watermelonpictures.com/films/the-encampments), [libraries](https://themidtowngazette.com/2024/10/in-the-fight-against-censorship-libraries-are-silent-on-palestine/), and other civic organizations use their influence to obscure Israeli atrocities, silence valid criticism, and promote false Israeli propaganda such as [conflation of criticism of Israel with antisemitism](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9-VeOsvkPz/). 
* We have seen thoroughly debunked disinformation from the Israeli lobby, [promoted by the Biden administration](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/27/biden-ignored-staff-warning-on-hamas-beheading-babies-claim-report), and repeated by the Trump administration, [as recently as August 11, 2025 by Mike Huckaby](https://zeteo.com/p/mehdi-debunks-mike-huckabees-gaza), about beheaded Israeli babies, [while actual Palestinian beheaded babies are ignored](https://khaledbeydoun.substack.com/p/the-rafah-tent-massacre-and-the-mythtruth).
* Within the context of such pervasive disinformation at all levels we feel a responsibility to educate the public so they can see the truth.
* **We all must do everything in our power to stop sending weapons to Israel and open up all avenues of humanitarian aid to Gaza.**


# What We Stand For
* We are opposed to all forms of racism, including antisemitism, Islamophobia, Zionism as an ethno-nationalist, ethno-supremacist ideology, and apartheid.
* We are for peace and are opposed to terrorism, where terrorism is defined consistently as violence against civilians and civilian infrastructure.
* We support freedom, equality, and justice for Palestinians.
* We support the peaceful coexistence of a multi-religious, democratic society in Palestine that protects the rights of minorities, gives equal rights to all its citizens.
* We support the boycott of, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel and companies that are complicit in the Israeli occupation and apartheid until there is an end to Israeli occupation, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing, resulting in freedom for Palestinians.

# What We Do
* We provide education about, and awareness of, the plight of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation, to the residents of Wellfleet, and beyond.
* We influence our local, state, and federal governments to support freedom for Palestinians using all peaceful means.

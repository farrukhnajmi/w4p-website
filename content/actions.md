# What Can We Do to Support Palestine
Many among us feel helpless as we watch this horrific genocide unfold and ask what can they do to help.

## Urgent Things You Can Do

### Donate Money for Gaza Relief
Here are some vetted organizations to donate money for Gaza Relief:

- [Gaza Soup Kitchen](https://gazasoupkitchen.com/)
- [Anera](https://www.anera.org/)
- [United Palestinian Appeal](https://upaconnect.org/)
- [Middle East Children’s Alliance (MECA)](https://www.mecaforpeace.org/)
- [United Nations Relief & Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA)](https://www.unrwa.org/)

### Support the Boycott of Israel

Here is how you can support the boycott of Israel.

1. Install the No Thanks App on your smart phone ([android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bashsoftware.boycott&hl=en_US&pli=1), [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/no-thanks-app/id6476206516)).
2. When you buy **anything** consult the app to make sure it is not on the Israel boycott. You can enter a product or company name or scan a barcode to check a product before you buy it.

If a product is on the boycott list the app will provide you with proof of why it is on the boycott list.

### Support Divestment of Funds from Companies Doing Business With Israel

- Divest your personal investments (e.g. retirement / 401K portfolio) from companies doing business with Israel.
- Demand that your muncipality and State divest from companies doing business with Israel.

Here is information on how to divest and the prioritized short list of companies to divest from:

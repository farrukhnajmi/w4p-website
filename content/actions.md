# What Can We Do to Support Palestine
Many among us feel helpless as we watch this horrific genocide unfold and ask what can they do to help.

## Urgent Things We Can Do

### Donate Money for Gaza Relief
Here are some vetted organizations to donate money for Gaza Relief:

- [Gaza Soup Kitchen](https://gazasoupkitchen.com/)
- [Anera](https://www.anera.org/)
- [United Palestinian Appeal](https://upaconnect.org/)
- [Middle East Children’s Alliance (MECA)](https://www.mecaforpeace.org/)
- [United Nations Relief & Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA)](https://www.unrwa.org/)
- [Doctors Against Genocide](https://doctorsagainstgenocide.org/donate)

### Support the Boycott of Israel

Here is how we can support the boycott of Israel.

1. Install the No Thanks App on our smart phone ([android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bashsoftware.boycott&hl=en_US&pli=1), [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/no-thanks-app/id6476206516)).
2. When buying **anything**, consult the app to make sure it is not on the Israel boycott. You can enter a product or company name or scan a barcode to check a product before buying it.

If a product is on the boycott list the app will provide a rationale for why it is on the boycott list and suggest alternative products where possible.

### Support Divestment of Funds from Companies Doing Business With Israel

- Divest personal investments (e.g. retirement / 401K portfolio) from companies doing business with Israel.
- Demand that our municipalities and State divest from companies doing business with Israel.

Here is information on how to divest and the prioritized short list of companies to divest from:

### Contact Your Senators and Representatives

Online action campaigns make it easy to call or send email to your two senators, your Congressional representative, as well as state representatives.
Here are the campaigns that are urgent and currently need our support:

- Call or email congress now and demand the immediate opening of ALL border crossings for unrestricted aid delivery: http://uscpract.org/GazaCall

Please [email us](mailto:wellfleet4palestine@gmail.com) if there are new urgent actions that should be listed here.

## Other Things We Can Do

### Attend Regular Standouts

Bring signs and banners. We are currently drawing attention to the fact that that 2 million people,
including 1 million children, are being starved to death by Israel's blockade of Gaza.

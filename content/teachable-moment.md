# A Teachable Moment in Wellfleet
On January 14, Wellfleet for Palestine (W4P) showed the film [The Occupation of the American Mind](https://youtu.be/dP0-YohJR-g?si=u482papWdea7QIDn) at Wellfleet Public Library as part of our ongoing Palestine Film Series. We always get some hateful comments when we post announcements for these public events. This time, it was a whole different level with a coordinated campaign of intimidation from outside groups in an attempt to silence our group and prevent the showing of this film. The Library staff got thousands of formulaic emails. Some patrons threatened to cut their Library cards and those of their children. The Town Manager and Town Hall staff got a flood of phone calls. Some homeowners threatened to sell their homes and leave town. There were veiled threats of violence in some messages. Members of Wellfleet for Palestine received hate messages as well. The massive coordinated effort to silence us makes the very point of the film.

W4P felt that showing this film was important to help people understand how support for the war in Gaza is being shaped by the media narrative we consume, and so is crucial in our effort to increase public awareness of the horrific genocide in Gaza, especially since our tax dollars are paying for the weapons being used against a densely caged civilian population with nowhere to go.

Wellfleet came together as a community to turn this crisis into a historical teachable moment. The Library Staff and Town Hall Staff handled the harassment with great fortitude. The Town Manager, Wellfleet Police Chief, and Select Board took proactive action to ensure that the event was safe for attendees and that the First Amendment rights to Free Speech for organizers as well as protesters were protected. The Town Manager and the Library Director both put out a thoughtful public statement before the event.

At the event, there were about 20 or so protesters. Many were from the Am HaYam synagogue in Orleans. They claimed that the film was antisemitic. Candace Perry, a beloved Wellfleet resident, and Peace activist, de-escalated the situation by talking to the protesters. She told them that she was Jewish, a founding member of Am HaYam, and wanted to see the film before forming an opinion. She invited them to come inside, watch the film, and then share their thoughts.

The event started with a meditative moment led by Lor Holmes and Mary Ellen Dwyer of W4P, to calm the audience and promote empathy for each other. A set of 3 Community Agreements was shared with the audience as rules for the event, starting with the Golden Rule. We then showed the abbreviated 45-minute version of the film to allow more time for discussion afterward.

During the discussion period, each speaker was allowed two minutes. No one was allowed to speak twice until everyone who wanted to speak, had done so.

What transpired was a civil and thoughtful discourse. All protestors got a chance to share their opinions. The most common critique was that the film was one-sided. The following are a few other critiques from protesters.

* What about all the other terrible things going on in the world?

* What about the bombing of Dresden, Hiroshima, or Nagasaki by the US?

* What about America committing genocide against native Americans?

**Interestingly, we do not recall a single protester citing an example of antisemitism in the film.**

Several Wellfleet residents, including Elaine Baskin, Judith Cumbler, and Candace Perry, expressed their angst, saying they were Jewish, supportive of showing the film, and appalled by the genocide being conducted in Gaza with their tax dollars.

W4P believes that the film informed and educated attendees and protesters alike. The de-escalation work by Wellfleet peace activists and W4P calmed a volatile situation and made us see our common humanity regardless of our tribal inclinations.

Similar events in other towns have led to violence and violations of free speech rights. Our event was a stellar example of Wellfleet keeping up its tradition of holding open and civil conversations about difficult topics despite differing opinions.

W4P is grateful for and proud of the proactive way our town's leadership and staff handled this difficult situation and balancing the rights of all its citizens and outside protesters.

At the risk of forgetting someone we would like to thank the following people and organizations:

* Library Director, and Library staff

* John Wolf, Ryan Curley, and the Select Board

* Town Manager, Tom Guerino, and Town Hall Staff

* Wellfleet Police Chief, Kevin LaRocco, Wellfleet Police Department, and the Officers present at the event

* Wellfleet ArtPeacemakers group and Candace Perry, and Catherine Hoffman for their de-escalation efforts

* Wellfleet Israel Palestine Study Group led by Elaine Baskin for their solidarity and support

* Wellfleet for Palestine for standing up for our rights

We love our beautiful little town of Wellfleet Massachusetts.
